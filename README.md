# Assignment-

I define two types: BankType and BranchType, which represent the bank and branch data structures, respectively.
The Query class defines the branches field, which resolves to a list of BranchType objects. I use a mock data list, but should replace it with your actual database query to fetch the branches.
The Flask application is created
